    "# Microheater Design\n",
    "\n",
    "Welcome to the exciting field of microdevices! In this exercise, we'll be focusing on a key player in the world of microsystems: the microheater. These crucial microdevices find applications in various sectors including gas sensing, biomedical systems, and electrical and mechanical fields. Microheaters typically consist of thin layers of conductive material structured in certain patterns to maximize their effective surface area. \n",
    "<br>\n",
    "Microheaters are at the core of many biomedical applications, including DNA amplification in devices like PCR (Polymerase Chain Reaction) machines and control of microenvironments in microphysiological systems (organs-on-chips). A high-performance microheater is essential to achieve precise thermal control, rapid thermal cycling, and ensure uniform heat distribution.\n",

    "**In this exercise, you have been assigned the task of designing such a microheater. It's not just any microheater, but one that is 100µm by 100µm in size and capable of achieving an output power density of 10kW.m<sup>-2</sup>, while keeping the current under `x` A. For this mission you will use the meander design from the above image. This ambitious specification is crucial to meet the stringent requirements of the portable diagnostic device and make it a reality.\n",
    "Keep in mind that these constraints should lead all of your choices in the different fabrication steps of the device.**\n",

    "- Global parameters:\n",
