    "# Metrology Notebook\n",

    "*This notebook covers the different techniques of metrology you can use in practice. The goal of the exercice is to determine what you are interested in measuring, what type of measure you want to do and which one are actually accessible at this time*\n",
    "\n",
    "First of all metrology allows you to make measures about different things from your sample, most of the time you want to observe the geometry of your sample : thickness, geometry of the surface, roughness. However thanks to cleanroom techniques you have access to many more measure types: resistivity, optical features, stress... \n",
    "One of the first constraint of metrology you must consider is the destructivity of the method you are using or not. Also some methods are accessible for certain materials but not for other depending on the physical property you want to measure.\n",
    "Last many method actually measure the same thing but are not aimed at the same scale (SEM vs normal microscopy, AFM vs profilometer), give some number"
