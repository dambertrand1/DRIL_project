They are thin film deposition techniques but are in a separate notebook as they are specific processes but widely used in industry for most of the processes. Thermal oxidation is required as the temperature speeds up the chemical reaction. At room temperature the oxidation wouldn't be possible (or limited to a few nanometers).__\n",

    "__Oxidation of silicon is crucial__ as the oxide of silicon SiO2 is an extremely important material in semi-conductor technology. It is used for various purposes such as gate dielectric in MOS (Metal-Oxide-Semiconductor) transistors, insulator layers in integrated circuits, and protective layers against contamination and damage. The highly insulating nature of SiO2 allows it to be an effective barrier between different layers in the device, preventing current leakage and ensuring high performance. Additionally, SiO2 also possesses excellent thermal stability and good chemical resistance, making it an ideal choice for use in harsh environments. Moreover, it plays a fundamental role in photolithography processes, which are vital for pattern definition in semiconductor device fabrication. Oxidation of silicon thus has a direct impact on the performance and reliability of a wide range of electronic devices.\n",

They are hold by a special holder which resist the extrem heat of the machine. These furnaces can perform both types of oxidation. However in practice each chamber of the furnace is reserved for a single type of oxidation for purity and conveniancy conserns. Moreover this step tends to always happend in the first steps of the process as it requires to have access to the silicon of the wafer (which isn't possible if it is covered by layers of materials). The heat of the process also makes it almost incompatible with any other previous step as could damage some layers or create great stress in the structure."

    "First you can observe that using a wet oxidation leads to a greater uncertainty in the final thickness of the layer. So dry oxidation is better addapted when you require an exact thickness of oxide. However it leads to a way longer process time. \n",

    "when silicon is exposed to an oxidizing environment, such as high-temperature steam or oxygen, the oxidation process initiates at the silicon surface and then progresses both into the silicon substrate (downward) and into the oxidizing environment (upward). This is because $SiO_2$ is formed by the reaction of silicon atoms in the substrate with oxygen atoms from the environment.\n",
    "\n",
    "The growth is downward into the silicon substrate because the oxygen atoms are able to diffuse through the already-formed $SiO_2$ layer, reach the Si-SiO2 interface, and react with more silicon atoms to form $SiO_2$. The growth is upward into the oxidizing environment as new $SiO_2$ molecules are formed at the Si-SiO2 interface, pushing the existing $SiO_2$ layer further into the oxidizing environment.\n",
    "\n",
    "This bidirectional growth leads to the $SiO_2$ layer thickness being larger than the amount of silicon consumed, with roughly half of the oxide growth extending into the silicon substrate and the other half extending outward. This observation is crucial for understanding and predicting the final thickness of the oxide layer, especially in the context of semiconductor device fabrication where precise control over layer dimensions is necessary."
